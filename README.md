# Movie-Finder
## Prompt:
A movie showtime finder (suggested implementation: web or mobile app with email or text message notifications). Build a program that notifies you, by text or email, about showtimes for potentially interesting movies playing at your favorite cinema. The concept of an 'interesting movie' can be derived using machine learning (if you watch enough movies to have good training data), or a handcrafted algorithm. For example, you might use the Open Movie Database API, paired with an HTML parser like BeautifulSoup, to build a program that alerts you to sci-fi movies rated 7.0 or above on IMDB, movies starring Amy Adams, and/or any movie with an average rating of 8.0 or higher.
